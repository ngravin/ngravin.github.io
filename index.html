This setting corresponds to the intersection of two matroids in the work of Kleinberg and Weinberg [40] and Feldman et al. [27]. We study a simple class of nonadaptive policies that we call vertex-additive policies. A vertex-additive policy assigns static prices to every vertex in the graph and accepts only those edges whose weight exceeds the sum of the prices on the edge endpoints. We show that there exists a vertex-additive policy with the expected payoff of at least one-third of the prophet’s payoff and present a gradient descent algorithm that quickly converges to the desired vector of vertex prices. Our results improve on the adaptive online policies of Kleinberg and Weinberg and Feldman et al. for the intersection of two matroids in two ways: our policy is nonadaptive and has a better approximation guarantee of 3 instead of the previous guarantees of 5.82 in Kleinberg and Weinberg and 5.43 in Feldman et al.

We consider dynamic markets, whose states evolve as a random walk in a market-specific Markov Chain. This is a new model that generalizes previous i.i.d. settings. We identify important parameters of the Markov chain that is crucial for obtaining good approximation guarantees to the expected value of the optimal offline algorithm which knows realizations of all requests in advance.

A classic example is the secretary problem and the game of googol, as well as its multiple combinatorial extensions such as (J, K)-secretary, 2-sided game of googol, ordinal-competitive matroid secretary. A natural approach to these tasks is to use ordinal online algorithms that at each step only consider relative ranking among the arrived elements, without looking at the numerical values of the input. We formally study the question of how cardinal algorithms (that can use numerical values of the input) can improve upon ordinal algorithms. We give first a universal construction of the input distribution for any ordinal online problem, such that the advantage of any cardinal algorithm over the ordinal algorithms is at most 1+ε for arbitrary small ε≥0. This implies that lower bounds from [Buchbinder, Jain, Singh, MOR 2014], [Nuti and Vondrák, SODA 2023] hold not only against any ordinal algorithm, but also against any online algorithm. Another immediate corollary is that cardinal algorithms are no better than ordinal algorithms in the matroid secretary problem with ordinal-competitive objective of [Soto, Turkieltaub, Verdugo, MOR 2021]. However, the value range of the input elements in our construction is huge: O(n^3 ⋅n! ⋅n!/ε) ↑↑(n-1) (tower of exponents) for an input sequence of length n. As a second result, we identify a class of natural ordinal problems and find cardinal algorithm with a matching advantage of 1+Ω(1/ log(c) N), where log(c) = log log ... log N with c iterative logs and c is an arbitrary constant c ≤n-2. This suggests that for relatively small input numerical values N the cardinal algorithms may be significantly better than the ordinal algorithms on the ordinal tasks, which are typically assumed to be almost indistinguishable prior to our work. This observation leads to a natural complexity measure (we dub it cardinal complexity) for any given ordinal online task: the minimum size N(ε) of different numerical values in the input such the advantage of cardinal over ordinal algorithms is at most 1+ε for any given ε≥0. As a third result, we show that the game of googol has much lower cardinal complexity of O((n/ε)^n). </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#6960EC"> <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/past-event-archive/soda23/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SODA 23</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="ArrivalOrder_BayesianSelection23" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">"Who is Next in Line?"

Our new measure is called order-competitive ratio. It is defined as the worst case (over all distribution sequences) ratio between the performance of the best order-unaware and order-aware algorithms, and quantifies the loss that is incurred due to lack of knowledge of the arrival order. Despite the growing interest in the role of the arrival order on the performance of online algorithms, this loss has been overlooked thus far. We study the order-competitive ratio in the paradigmatic prophet inequality problem, for the two common objective functions of (i) maximizing the expected value, and (ii) maximizing the probability of obtaining the largest value; and with respect to two families of algorithms, namely (i) adaptive algorithms, and (ii) single-threshold algorithms. We provide tight bounds for all four combinations, with respect to deterministic algorithms. Our analysis requires new ideas and departs from standard techniques. In particular, our adaptive algorithms inevitably go beyond single-threshold algorithms. The results with respect to the order-competitive ratio measure capture the intuition that adaptive algorithms are stronger than single-threshold ones, and may lead to a better algorithmic advice than the classical competitive ratio measure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#6960EC"> <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/past-event-archive/soda23/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SODA 23</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="BSP_Costs23" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bidder Subset Selection Problem in Auction Design</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://xiaohuibei.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xiaohui Bei</a>, Nick Gravin, <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a>, and <a href="http://zhihaotang.com/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zhihao Gavin Tang</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2023 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, SODA 2023, Florence, Italy, January 22-25, 2023</em>, Nov 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10969" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Motivated by practical concerns in the online advertising industry, we study a bidder subset selection problem in single-item auctions. In this problem, a large pool of candidate bidders have independent values sampled from known prior distributions. The seller needs to pick a subset of bidders and run a given auction format on the selected subset to maximize her expected revenue. We propose two frameworks for the subset restrictions: (i) capacity constraint on the set of selected bidders; and (ii) incurred costs for the bidders invited to the auction. For the second-price auction with anonymous reserve (SPA-AR), we give constant approximation polynomial time algorithms in both frameworks (in the latter framework under mild assumptions about the market). Our results are in stark contrast to the previous work of Mehta, Nadav, Psomas, Rubinstein [NeurIPS 2020], who showed hardness of approximation for the SPA without a reserve price. We also give complimentary approximation results for other well-studied auction formats such as anonymous posted pricing and sequential posted pricing.

Our work considers the sample-based prophet inequality with less than one sample per distribution, i.e., scenarios with no prior information about some of the random variables. Specifically, we propose a p-sample model, where a sample from each distribution is revealed with probability p∈[0,1] independently across all distributions. This model generalizes the single-sample setting of Rubinstein, Wang, and Weinberg (ITCS 2021), and the i.i.d. prophet inequality with a linear number of samples of Correa et al. (EC 2019).

Indeed, it anonymously selects a provisional winner by a symmetric ascending-price process, and only then uses a personalized posted price. A LA auction extracts at least 1/2 of the optimal revenue, even under a correlated value distribution. This bound is tight, even for 2 buyers with independent values. We introduce a natural extension of LA, called lookahead with pooling (LAP). A LAP auction proceeds as LA, with one difference: it allows the seller to pool together a range of values during the ascending-price stage, and treat them the same; thus, it preserves the simplicity and fairness of LA. Our main result is that this simple pooling operation improves the revenue guarantees for independent buyers from 1/2 to 4/7 of the optimal revenue.

Each buyer i has a private value vi for receiving this service, and some feasibility constraint restricts which subsets of buyers can be served simultaneously. Recent work in economics introduced (deferred-acceptance) clock auctions as a superior class of auctions for this problem, due to their transparency, simplicity, and very strong incentive guarantees. Subsequent work in computer science focused on evaluating these auctions with respect to their social welfare approximation guarantees, leading to strong impossibility results: in the absence of prior information regarding the buyers’ values, no deterministic clock auction can achieve a bounded approximation, even for simple feasibility constraints with only two maximal feasible sets.We show that these negative results can be circumvented either by using access to prior information or by leveraging randomization. In particular, we provide clock auctions that give a O(log log k) approximation for general downward-closed feasibility constraints with k maximal feasible sets, for three different information models, ranging from full access to the value distributions to complete absence of information. The more information the seller has, the simpler and more practical these auctions are. Under full access, we use a particularly simple deterministic clock auction, called a single-price clock auction, which is only slightly more complex than posted price mechanisms. In this auction, each buyer is offered a single price, then a feasible set is selected among those who accept their offers. In the other extreme, where no prior information is available, this approximation guarantee is obtained using a complex randomized clock auction. In addition to our main results, we propose a parameterization that interpolates between single-price clock auctions and general clock auctions, paving the way for an exciting line of future research.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">MOR</abbr> </div> <div id="PI_MatchingTwoSidedArrivals22" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Prophet Matching with General Arrivals</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://tomer-ezra.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tomer Ezra</a>, <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michal Feldman</a>, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://zhihaotang.com/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zhihao Gavin Tang</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Math.

Here, we assume that such events are only pair-wise independent; this gives rise to a much richer space of instances. Our aim has been to explore whether positive results are possible even under the more general assumptions. We show that this is indeed the case.Indicatively, we show that, when applied to pair-wise independent distributions of buyer values, sequential posted pricing mechanisms get at least 11.299 of the revenue they get from mutually independent distributions with the same marginals. We also adapt the well-known prophet inequality to pair-wise independent distributions of prize values to get a 1/3-approximation using a non-standard uniform threshold strategy. Finally, in a stochastic model of generating random bipartite graphs with pair-wise independence on the edges, we show that the expected size of the maximum matching is large but considerably smaller than in Erdős-Renyi random graph models where edges are selected independently. Our techniques include a technical lemma that might find applications in other interesting settings involving pair-wise independence.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#6960EC"> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976465" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SODA 21</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="k_Independence_CRYPTO21" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Concentration bounds for almost k-wise independence with applications to non-uniform security</div> <div class="author"> Nick Gravin, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/siyaoguo/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Siyao Guo</a>, <a href="https://itcs.sufe.edu.cn/54/20/c10495a152608/page.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tsz Chiu Kwok</a>, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In </em>, Virtual Event, Virginia, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/SODA/soda21.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We prove a few concentration inequalities for the sum of n binary random variables under weaker conditions than k-wise independence. Namely, we consider two standard conditions that are satisfied in many applications: (a) direct product conditions (b) the XOR condition. Both conditions are weaker than mutual independence and both imply strong concentration bounds (similar to Chernoff-Hoeffding) on the tail probability of the sum of bounded random variables ([Impagliazzo and Kabanets, APPROX-RANDOM 10], [Unger, FOCS 09]). Our inequalities can be stated as the implication of threshold direct product theorems from either k-wise direct product conditions, or the k-wise XOR condition. By proving optimality of our inequalities, we show a clear separation for k ≪n between k-wise product conditions and XOR condition as well as a stark contrast between k-wise and n-wise product theorems. We use these bounds in the cryptographic application that provides provable security against algorithms with S-bit advice. Namely, we show how the problem reduces to proving S-wise direct product theorems or S-wise XOR lemmas for certain ranges of parameters. Finally, we derive a new S-wise XOR lemma, which yields a tight non-uniform bound for length increasing pseudorandom generators, resolving a 10-year-old open problem from [De, Trevisan, and Tulsiani, CRYPTO 10].</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#6960EC"> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611975482" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SODA 19</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Correlation_Robust_One_Item19" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Correlation-robust analysis of single item auction</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://xiaohuibei.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xiaohui Bei</a>, Nick Gravin, <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a>, and <a href="http://zhihaotang.com/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zhihao Gavin Tang</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</em>, San Diego, California, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/SODA/soda19.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We investigate the problem of revenue maximization in single-item auction within the new correlation-robust framework proposed by Carroll [2017] and further developed by Gravin and Lu [2018].

The social welfare function, which is the standard measure of efficiency in auctions, is inadequate for settings with budgets, since there may be a large disconnect between the value a bidder derives from obtaining an item and what can be liquidated from her. The Liquid Welfare objective function has been suggested as a natural alternative for settings with budgets. Simple auctions, like simultaneous item auctions, are evaluated by their performance at equilibrium using the Price of Anarchy (PoA) measure – the ratio of the objective function value of the optimal outcome to the worst equilibrium. Accordingly, we evaluate the performance of simultaneous item auctions in budgeted settings by the Liquid Price of Anarchy (LPoA) measure – the ratio of the optimal Liquid Welfare to the Liquid Welfare obtained in the worst equilibrium. For pure Nash equilibria of simultaneous first price auctions, we obtain a bound of 2 on the LPoA for additive buyers. Our results easily extend to the larger class of fractionally-subadditive valuations. Next we show that the LPoA of mixed Nash equilibria for first price auctions with additive bidders is bounded by a constant. Our proofs are robust, and can be extended to achieve similar bounds for Bayesian Nash equilibria. To derive our results, we develop a new technique in which some bidders deviate (surprisingly) toward a non-optimal solution. In particular, this technique goes beyond the smoothness-based approach.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">SICOMP</abbr> </div> <div id="Budget_Feasible_Bayesian17" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Worst-Case Mechanism Design via Bayesian Analysis</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://xiaohuibei.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xiaohui Bei</a>, Ning Chen, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIAM J.

One of the most important questions in the field is “which valuation domains admit truthful budget feasible mechanisms with ‘small’ approximations to the social optimum?” Singer [Proceedings of the 51st FOCS, IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, 2010, pp. 765–774] showed that submodular functions have a constant approximation mechanism. Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer [Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce, ACM, New York, 2011, pp. 273–282] gave an O(log^2n) approximation mechanism for subadditive functions and remarked that “A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational constraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive functions.” In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question. To this end we relax the prior-free mechanism design framework to the Bayesian mechanism design framework (these are two standard approaches from computer science and economics, respectively). Then we convert our results in the Bayesian setting back to the prior-free framework by employing Yao’s minimax principle. Along the way, we obtain the following results: (i) a polynomial time constant approximation for XOS valuations (a.k.a. fractionally subadditive valuations, a superset of submodular functions), (ii) a polynomial time O(log n / log log n)-approximation for general subadditive valuations, (iii) a constant approximation for general subadditive functions in the Bayesian framework—we allow correlation in the distribution of sellers’ costs and provide a universally truthful mechanism, (iv) the existence of a prior-free constant approximation mechanism via Yao’s minimax principle.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:Turquoise"> <a href="https://www.sigecom.org/ec16/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC 16</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Procrastination16" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Procrastination with Variable Present Bias</div> <div class="author"> Nick Gravin, <a href="https://immorlica.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nicole Immorlica</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brendan Lucier</a>, and Emmanouil Pountourakis </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation</em>, Maastricht, The Netherlands, Jan 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03062" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Individuals working towards a goal often exhibit time inconsistent behavior, making plans and then failing to follow through. One well-known model of such behavioral anomalies is present-bias discounting: individuals over-weight present costs by a bias factor. This model explains many time-inconsistent behaviors, but can make stark predictions in many settings: individuals either follow the most efficient plan for reaching their goal or procrastinate indefinitely. We propose a modification in which the present-bias parameter can vary over time, drawn independently each step from a fixed distribution. Following Kleinberg and Oren (2014), we use a weighted it task graph to model task planning, and measure the cost of procrastination as the relative expected cost of the chosen path versus the optimal path. We use a novel connection to optimal pricing theory to describe the structure of the worst-case task graph for any present-bias distribution. We then leverage this structure to derive conditions on the bias distribution under which the worst-case ratio is exponential (in time) or constant. We also examine conditions on the task graph that lead to improved procrastination ratios: graphs with a uniformly bounded distance to the goal, and graphs in which the distance to the goal monotonically decreases on any path.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">SICOMP</abbr> </div> <div id="CWE16" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Combinatorial Walrasian Equilibrium</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michal Feldman</a>, Nick Gravin, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brendan Lucier</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>SIAM J.

The classic solution concept for such problems is Walrasian equilibrium (WE), which provides a simple and transparent pricing structure that achieves optimal social welfare. The main weakness of the WE notion is that it exists only in very restrictive cases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the notion of a combinatorial Walrasian equilibium (CWE), a natural relaxation of WE. The difference between a CWE and a (noncombinatorial) WE is that the seller can package the items into indivisible bundles prior to sale, and the market does not necessarily clear. We show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that obtains at least half the optimal (unconstrained) social welfare. Moreover, we devise a polynomial time algorithm that, given an arbitrary allocation, computes a CWE that achieves at least half its welfare. Thus, the economic problem of finding a CWE with high social welfare reduces to the algorithmic problem of social-welfare approximation. In addition, we show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare as revenue. Finally, to motivate the use of bundles, we establish strong lower bounds when the seller is restricted to using item prices only. The strength of our results derives partly from their generality—our results hold for arbitrary valuations that may exhibit complex combinations of substitutes and complements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:Turquoise"> <a href="https://www.sigecom.org/ec15/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC 15</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Competitive_BenchmarkDecomposition15" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Competitive Analysis via Benchmark Decomposition</div> <div class="author"> Ning Chen, Nikolai Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation</em>, Portland, Oregon, USA, Jan 2015 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2079" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We propose a uniform approach for the design and analysis of prior-free competitive auctions and online auctions. Our philosophy is to view the benchmark function as a variable parameter of the model and study a broad class of functions instead of a individual target benchmark. We consider a multitude of well-studied auction settings, and improve upon a few previous results. First, for multi-unit auctions, given a β-competitive unlimited supply auction, the best previously known multi-unit auction is 2β-competitive. We design a (1+β)-competitive auction reducing the ratio from 4.84 to 3.24. These results carry over to matroid and position auctions. Second, for general downward-closed environments, we design a 6.5-competitive auction improving upon the ratio of 7.5. Our auction is noticeably simpler than the previous best one. Third, for unlimited supply online auctions, our analysis yields an auction with a competitive ratio of 4.12, which significantly narrows the margin of [4, 4.84] previously known for this problem. A particularly important tool in our analysis is a simple decomposition lemma, which allows us to bound the competitive ratio against a sum of benchmark functions. We use this lemma in a “divide and conquer” fashion by dividing the target benchmark into the sum of simpler functions. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">MOR</abbr> </div> <div id="Truthful_GA_via_StableMatching14" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Truthful Generalized Assignments via Stable Matching</div> <div class="author"> Ning Chen, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Math.

For every job-machine pair, there are a specific value and an accommodated capacity for the assignment. The objective is to find an assignment that maximizes the total sum of values given that the capacity constraint of every machine is satisfied.The gap is a classic optimization problem and has been studied extensively from the algorithmic perspective. Dughmi and Ghosh [Dughmi S, Ghosh A (2010) Truthful assignment without money. ACM Conf. Electronic Commerce (ACM, New York), 325–334.] proposed the game theoretical framework in which every job is owned by a selfish agent who aims to maximize the value of his own assignment. They gave a logarithmic approximation truthful in expectation mechanism and left open the problem whether there exists a truthful mechanism with a constant approximation factor. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question and provide a constant approximation mechanism that enjoys a stronger incentive property of universal truthfulness than that of truthfulness in expectation.Our mechanism is inspired by stable matching, which is a fundamental solution concept in the context of matching marketplaces. The mechanism uses a stable matching algorithm as a critical component and adopts other approaches like random sampling.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#000080"> <a href="https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2014/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">STOC 14</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="DigitalGoods14" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optimal competitive auctions</div> <div class="author"> Ning Chen, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Forty-Sixth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</em>, New York, New York, Aug 2014 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0880" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We study the design of truthful auctions for selling identical items in unlimited supply (e.g., digital goods) to n unit demand buyers. This classic problem stands out from profit-maximizing auction design literature as it requires no probabilistic assumptions on buyers’ valuations and employs the framework of competitive analysis. Our objective is to optimize the worst-case performance of an auction, measured by the ratio between a given benchmark and revenue generated by the auction. We establish a sufficient and necessary condition that characterizes competitive ratios for all monotone benchmarks. The characterization identifies the worst-case distribution of instances and reveals intrinsic relations between competitive ratios and benchmarks in the competitive analysis. With the characterization at hand, we show optimal competitive auctions for two natural benchmarks. The most well-studied benchmark F^(2) measures the envy-free optimal revenue where at least two buyers win. Goldberg et al. [13] showed a sequence of lower bounds on the competitive ratio for each number of buyers n. They conjectured that all these bounds are tight. We show that optimal competitive auctions match these bounds. Thus, we confirm the conjecture and settle a central open problem in the design of digital goods auctions. As one more application we examine another economically meaningful benchmark, which measures the optimal revenue across all limited-supply Vickrey auctions. We identify the optimal competitive ratios to be (n/(n-1))^(n-1)-1 for each number of buyers n, that is e-1 as n approaches infinity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#79BAEC"> <a href="https://www.icalp2013.lu.lv/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICALP 13</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Externalities_DigitalGoods13" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Competitive auctions for markets with positive externalities</div> <div class="author"> Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Automata, Languages, and Programming - Volume Part II</em>, Riga, Latvia, Aug 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5221" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In digital goods auctions, the auctioneer sells an item in unlimited supply to a set of potential buyers. The objective is to design a truthful auction that maximizes the auctioneer’s total profit. Motivated by the observation that the buyers’ valuation of the good might be interconnected through a social network, we study digital goods auctions with positive externalities among buyers. This defines a multi-parameter auction design problem where the private valuation of every buyer is a function of the set of other winning buyers. The main contribution of this paper is a truthful competitive mechanism for subadditive valuations. Our competitive result is with respect to a new solution benchmark F^(3). On the other hand, we show a surprising impossibility result if comparing to the stronger benchmark F^(2), where the latter has been used quite successfully in digital goods auctions without externalities [16].</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#000080"> <a href="https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2013/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">STOC 13</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Simultaneous_Subadditive13" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Simultaneous auctions are (almost) efficient</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michal Feldman</a>, <a href="https://www.fuhuthu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hu Fu</a>, Nick Gravin, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brendan Lucier</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Forty-Fifth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</em>, Palo Alto, California, USA, Aug 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4703" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Simultaneous item auctions are simple and practical procedures for allocating items to bidders with potentially complex preferences. In a simultaneous auction, every bidder submits independent bids on all items simultaneously. The allocation and prices are then resolved for each item separately, based solely on the bids submitted on that item. We study the efficiency of Bayes-Nash equilibrium (BNE) outcomes of simultaneous first- and second-price auctions when bidders have complement-free (a.k.a. subadditive) valuations. While it is known that the social welfare of every pure Nash equilibrium (NE) constitutes a constant fraction of the optimal social welfare, a pure NE rarely exists, and moreover, the full information assumption is often unrealistic. Therefore, quantifying the welfare loss in Bayes-Nash equilibria is of particular interest. Previous work established a logarithmic bound on the ratio between the social welfare of a BNE and the expected optimal social welfare in both first-price auctions (Hassidim et al., 2011) and second-price auctions (Bhawalkar and Roughgarden, 2011), leaving a large gap between a constant and a logarithmic ratio. We introduce a new proof technique and use it to resolve both of these gaps in a unified way. Specifically, we show that the expected social welfare of any BNE is at least 1/2 of the optimal social welfare in the case of first-price auctions, and at least 1/4 in the case of second-price auctions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#000080"> <a href="https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2013/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">STOC 13</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="CWE13" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Combinatorial walrasian equilibrium</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michal Feldman</a>, Nick Gravin, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brendan Lucier</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Forty-Fifth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</em>, Palo Alto, California, USA, Aug 2013 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2244" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We study a combinatorial market design problem, where a collection of indivisible objects is to be priced and sold to potential buyers subject to equilibrium constraints. The classic solution concept for such problems is Walrasian Equilibrium (WE), which provides a simple and transparent pricing structure that achieves optimal social welfare. The main weakness of the WE notion is that it exists only in very restrictive cases. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the notion of a Combinatorial Walrasian equilibium (CWE), a natural relaxation of WE. The difference between a CWE and a (non-combinatorial) WE is that the seller can package the items into indivisible bundles prior to sale, and the market does not necessarily clear. We show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that obtains at least half of the optimal (unconstrained) social welfare. Moreover, we devise a poly-time algorithm that, given an arbitrary allocation X, computes a CWE that achieves at least half of the welfare of X. Thus, the economic problem of finding a CWE with high social welfare reduces to the algorithmic problem of social-welfare approximation. In addition, we show that every valuation profile admits a CWE that extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare as revenue. Finally, these results are complemented by strong lower bounds when the seller is restricted to using item prices only, which motivates the use of bundles. The strength of our results derives partly from their generality — our results hold for arbitrary valuations that may exhibit complex combinations of substitutes and complements.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#000080"> <a href="https://acm-stoc.org/stoc2012/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">STOC 12</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Budget_Feasible_Bayesian12" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Budget feasible mechanism design: from prior-free to bayesian</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://xiaohuibei.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xiaohui Bei</a>, Ning Chen, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Forty-Fourth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing</em>, New York, New York, USA, Aug 2012 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4455" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Budget feasible mechanism considers algorithmic mechanism design questions where there is a budget constraint on the total payment of the mechanism. An important question in the field is that under which valuation domains there exist budget feasible mechanisms that admit ‘small’ approximations (compared to a socially optimal solution). Singer [35] showed that additive and submodular functions admit a constant approximation mechanism. Recently, Dobzinski, Papadimitriou, and Singer [20] gave an O(log^2(n)) approximation mechanism for subadditive functions and remarked that: “A fundamental question is whether, regardless of computational constraints, a constant-factor budget feasible mechanism exists for subadditive function." In this paper, we give the first attempt to this question. We give a polynomial time O(log n/log log n) sub-logarithmic approximation ratio mechanism for subadditive functions, improving the best known ratio O(log^2(n)). Further, we connect budget feasible mechanism design to the concept of approximate core in cooperative game theory, and show that there is a mechanism for subadditive functions whose approximation is, via a characterization of the integrality gap of a linear program, linear to the largest value to which an approximate core exists. Our result implies in particular that the class of XOS functions, which is a superclass of submodular functions, admits a constant approximation mechanism. We believe that our work could be a solid step towards solving the above fundamental problem eventually, and possibly, with an affirmative answer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2011</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#6960EC"> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611973082" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SODA 11</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="Budget_Feasible_Submodular11" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the approximability of budget feasible mechanisms</div> <div class="author"> Ning Chen, Nick Gravin, and <a href="http://pinyanlu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pinyan Lu</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</em>, San Francisco, California, Aug 2011 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3801" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Budget feasible mechanisms, recently initiated by Singer (FOCS 2010), extend algorithmic mechanism design problems to a realistic setting with a budget constraint.

In this setting, frugality [2] provides a measure to evaluate the "cost of truthfulness", that is, the overpayment of a truthful mechanism relative to the "fair" payment. We propose a uniform scheme for designing frugal truthful mechanisms for general set systems. Our scheme is based on scaling the agents’ bids using the eigenvector of a matrix that encodes the interdependencies between the agents. We demonstrate that the r-out-of-k-system mechanism and the √-mechanism for buying a path in a graph [18] can be viewed as instantiations of our scheme. We then apply our scheme to two other classes of set systems, namely, vertex cover systems and k-path systems, in which a customer needs to purchase k edge-disjoint source-sink paths. For both settings, we bound the frugality of our mechanism in terms of the largest eigenvalue of the respective interdependency matrix. We show that our mechanism is optimal for a large subclass of vertex cover systems satisfying a simple local sparsity condition. For k-path systems, our mechanism is within a factor of k+1 from optimal, moreover, we show that it is, in fact, optimal, when one uses a modified definition of frugality proposed in [10]. Our lower bound argument combines spectral techniques and Young’s inequality, and is applicable to all set systems. As both r-out-of-k systems and single path systems can be viewed as special cases of k-path systems, our result improves the lower bounds of [18] and answers several open questions proposed in [18].</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#BCE954"> <a href="https://www.issac-conference.org/2010/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ISAAC 10</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="CNN_Continuous10" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">On the Continuous CNN Problem</div> <div class="author"> <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~augustine/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">John Augustine</a>, and Nick Gravin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Algorithms and Computation - 21st International Symposium, ISAAC 2010, Jeju Island, Korea, December 15-17, 2010, Proceedings, Part II</em>, Aug 2010 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2393" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In the (discrete) CNN problem, online requests appear as points in R^2.

The best known competitive ratio for the discrete version is 879 (due to Sitters and Stougie). We study the continuous version, in which, the request can move continuously in R^2 and the server must continuously serve the request. A simple adversarial argument shows that the lower bound on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm for the continuous CNN problem is 3. Our main contribution is an online algorithm with competitive ratio. Our analysis is tight. The continuous version generalizes the discrete orthogonal CNN problem, in which every request must be x or y aligned with the previous request.

In [3] it has been observed that if such an auction is conducted using first-price rules, then, counterintuitively, the buyer’s payment may go down if some of the sellers are prohibited from participating in the auction. This reduction in payments has been termed "the cost of cheap labor". In this paper, we demonstrate that the buyer can attain further savings by setting lower bounds on sellers’ bids. Our model is a refinement of the original model of [3]: indeed, the latter can be obtained from the former by requiring these lower bounds to take values in {0, +infty }. We provide upper and lower bounds on the reduction in the buyer’s payments in our model for various set systems, such as minimum spanning tree auctions, bipartite matching auctions, single path and k -path auctions, vertex cover auctions, and dominating set auctions. In particular, we illustrate the power of the new model by showing that for vertex cover auctions, in our model the buyer’s savings can be linear, whereas in the original model of [3] no savings can be achieved.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </li> <li> <h4> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleDropdown('learning')" style="color: inherit"><b>Learning Theory</b></a> </h4> <div id="learning" class="dropdown-content"> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:#307D7E"> <a href="https://www.learningtheory.org/colt2018/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">COLT 18</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="TestingMC_18" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Testing Symmetric Markov Chains From a Single Trajectory</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Constantinos Daskalakis</a>, Nishanth Dikkala, and Nick Gravin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Conference On Learning Theory, COLT 2018, Stockholm, Sweden, 6-9 July 2018</em>, 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06850" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Classical distribution testing assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution that is being tested.

We use the connection we develop to random walks to derive an improved algorithm and regret bound for the case of 4 experts, and, provide a general framework for designing the optimal algorithm and adversary for an arbitrary number of experts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </li> <li> <h4> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleDropdown('nash-comp')" style="color: inherit"><b>Approximate Nash Equilibria</b></a> </h4> <div id="nash-comp" class="dropdown-content"> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Algorithmica</abbr> </div> <div id="ApproxNE_CSG17" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Short Sequences of Improvement Moves Lead to Approximate Equilibria in Constraint Satisfaction Games</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ioannis Caragiannis</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/angelofanelli" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Angelo Fanelli</a>, and Nick Gravin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Algorithmica</em>, Apr 2017 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3450" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We present an algorithm that computes approximate pure Nash equilibria in a broad class of constraint satisfaction games that generalize the well-known cut and party affiliation games.

Pure Nash equilibria in a game characterize situations with non-cooperative deterministic players in which no player has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from the current situation in order to achieve a higher payoff. Unfortunately, it is well known that there are games that do not have pure Nash equilibria. Furhermore, even in games where the existence of equilibria is guaranteed, their computation can be a computationally hard task. Such negative results significantly question the importance of pure Nash equilibria as solution concepts that characterize the behavior of rational players. Approximate pure Nash equilibria, which characterize situations where no player can significantly improve her payoff by unilaterally deviating from her current strategy, could serve as alternative solution concepts provided that they exist and can be computed efficiently.

We present a surprisingly simple polynomial-time algorithm that computes O(1)-approximate Nash equilibria in these games. In particular, for congestion games with linear latency functions, our algorithm computes (2+ε)-approximate pure Nash equilibria in time polynomial in the number of players, the number of resources and 1/ε. It also applies to games with polynomial latency functions with constant maximum degree d; there, the approximation guarantee is d^O(d). The algorithm essentially identifies a polynomially long sequence of best-response moves that lead to an approximate equilibrium, the existence of such short sequences is interesting in itself. These are the first positive algorithmic results for approximate equilibria in non-symmetric congestion games. We strengthen them further by proving that, for congestion games that deviate from our mild assumptions, computing rho-approximate equilibria is sf PLS-complete for any polynomial-time computable ρ.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </div> </li> <li> <h4> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleDropdown('fair-division')" style="color: inherit"><b>Fair-Division</b></a> </h4> <div id="fair-division" class="dropdown-content"> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100" style="background-color:Turquoise"> <a href="https://www.sigecom.org/ec19/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EC 19</a> </abbr> </div> <div id="EF_Donating19" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Envy-Freeness Up to Any Item with High Nash Welfare: The Virtue of Donating Items</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~iannis/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ioannis Caragiannis</a>, Nick Gravin, and Xin Huang </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation</em>, Phoenix, AZ, USA, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04319" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Several fairness concepts have been proposed recently in attempts to approximate envy-freeness in settings with indivisible goods. Among them, the concept of envy-freeness up to any item (EFX) is arguably the closest to envy-freeness. Unfortunately, EFX allocations are not known to exist except in a few special cases. We make significant progress in this direction. We show that for every instance with additive valuations, there is an EFX allocation of a subset of items with a Nash welfare that is at least half of the maximum possible Nash welfare for the original set of items. That is, after donating some items to a charity, one can distribute the remaining items in a fair way with high efficiency. This bound is proved to be best possible. Our proof is constructive and highlights the importance of maximum Nash welfare allocation. Starting with such an allocation, our algorithm decides which items to donate and redistributes the initial bundles to the agents, eventually obtaining an allocation with the claimed efficiency guarantee. The application of our algorithm to large markets, where the valuations of an agent for every item is relatively small, yields EFX with almost optimal Nash welfare. We also show that our algorithm can be modified to compute, in polynomial-time, EFX allocations that approximate optimal Nash welfare within a factor of at most 2ρ, using a ρ-approximate allocation on input instead of the maximum Nash welfare one.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Int.

In a multiple tiling, a convex body P is translated with a discrete multiset Λin such a way that each point of R^d gets covered exactly k times, except perhaps the translated copies of the boundary of P. It is known that all possible multiple tilers in R^3 are zonotopes. In R^2 it was known by the work of M. Kolountzakis (Discrete Comput Geom 23(4):537—553, 2000) that, unless P is a parallelogram, the multiset of translation vectors Λmust be a finite union of translated lattices (also known as quasi-periodic sets). In that work the author asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation vectors would be true in R^3. Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true for R^3. Namely, we show that if P is a convex multiple tiler in R^3, with a discrete multiset Λ of translation vectors, then Λ has to be a finite union of translated lattices, unless P belongs to a special class of zonotopes. This exceptional class consists of two-flat zonotopes P, defined by the Minkowski sum of two 2-dimensional symmetric polygons in R^3, one of which may degenerate into a single line segment. It turns out that rational two-flat zonotopes admit a multiple tiling with an aperiodic (non-quasi-periodic) set of translation vectors Λ.

In particular, we show that the vertices of an N-vertex polytope in \mathbbR^d can be reconstructed from the knowledge of O(D⋅N) axial moments (w.r.t. to an unknown polynomial measure of degree D) in d+1 distinct generic directions. Our approach is based on the collection of moment formulas due to Brion, Lawrence, Khovanskii-Pukhikov, and Barvinok that arise in the discrete geometry of polytopes, and what variously known as Prony’s method, or Vandermonde factorization of finite rank Hankel matrices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Combinatorica</abbr> </div> <div id="Tillings_Polytope12" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Translational tilings by a polytope, with multiplicity</div> <div class="author"> Nick Gravin, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sinairobins" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sinai Robins</a>, and Dmitry Shiryaev </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Comb.</em>, Oct 2012 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3163" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We study the problem of covering R^d by overlapping translates of a convex body P, such that almost every point of R^d is covered exactly k times. Such a covering of Euclidean space by translations is called a k-tiling. The investigation of tilings (i.e. 1-tilings in this context) by translations began with the work of Fedorov [5] and Minkowski [15]. Here we extend the investigations of Minkowski to k-tilings by proving that if a convex body k-tiles R^d by translations, then it is centrally symmetric, and its facets are also centrally symmetric. These are the analogues of Minkowski’s conditions for 1-tiling polytopes. Conversely, in the case that P is a rational polytope, we also prove that if P is centrally symmetric and has centrally symmetric facets, then P must k-tile R^d for some positive integer k.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </li> <li> <h4> <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleDropdown('graph-theory')" style="color: inherit"><b>Graph Theory</b></a> </h4> <div id="graph-theory" class="dropdown-content"> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Zap.
