I am Professor at the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME) of
Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SHUFE), a member of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS).

<br>
I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability Theory. Most of my work in particular is about various aspects of algorithmic auction design and equilibria computation in Algorithmic Game Theory. I also work(ed) on online matching and Bayesian selection in the area of Online Algorithms; on graph colorings and spanning trees in Graph Theory; on inverse moment problems and tilings of space in Convex Geometry; on prediction with expert advice in online Learning Theory.
<br>
<br>
Before joining SHUFE in 2017, I have spent 1 year as a postdoc at <a href='https://csail.mit.edu/'>MIT-CSAIL</a> (hosted by <a href='https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/'>Costis Daskalakis</a>) in 2016, and 2 years at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/'>Microsoft Research New England</a> (supervisor: <a href='http://jenniferchayes.com/'>Jennifer Chayes</a>) in 2013-2015.
<br>
<br>
I hold 2 PhDs: (i) in mathematics from <a href="https://www.pdmi.ras.ru/eng/institut/institut.php">St-Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute</a> in Russia, where I worked on certain aspects of graph colorings under supervision of <a href="https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~dvk/">Dmitri Karpov</a>; (ii) in computer science from <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/spms">Nanyang Technological University</a> in Singapore  with the PhD thesis on design of procurement auctions under supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/dmitrii.pasechnik/">Dmitrii Pasechnik</a> and guidance from other faculties at NTU (Ning Chen, <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/">Edith Elkind</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sinairobins">Sinai Robins</a>).
