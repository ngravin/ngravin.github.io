I am Professor at the School of Information Management and Engineering (SIME) of
Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SHUFE), a member of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS). I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability Theory. I am particularly interested in auction design and equilibria computation in the field of Algorithmic Game Theory; Online Matching, Bayesian Selection, in the field of Online Algorithms, Graph Colorings in Graph Theory, Inverse Moment Problems and Tilings of Space in Convex Geometry. Before joining SHUFE in 2017 I did postdocs at <a href='https://csail.mit.edu/'>MIT-CSAIL</a> (hosted by <a href='https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/'>Costis Daskalakis</a>) in 2016, and at <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/'>Microsoft Research New England</a> (supervisor: <a href='http://jenniferchayes.com/'>Jennifer Chayes</a>) in 2013-2015.
